# ConwaysLife
A famous ‘cellular automata’ 0-player game from 1970

Conway’s Life: Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies,
as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on
to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours
dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours
becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This Java recreation of Conwayslife uses/features:
* Jframe: AWT and mainly Swing components for rendering graphics,handling user input and UI for the game. 
* Threading: For smooth and responsive game updates and animations.
* 5 Functions: EDIT (lets you edit the board), RANDOM (fill the board with random dead/alive cells), SAVE (Lets you save the board in a file), LOAD (Lets you load the board from a file), RUN (runs the game according to the "rules of life")
